There is nothing innocuous left. The little pleasures, expressions of life
that seemed exempt from the responsibility of thought, not only have an element
of defiant silliness, of callous refusal to see, but directly serve their
diametrical opposite. Even the blossoming tree lies the moment its bloom
is seen without the shadow of terror; even the innocent 'How lovely!' becomes
an excuse for an existence outrageously unlovely, and there is no longer
beauty or consolation except in the gaze falling on horror, withstanding
it, and in unalleviated consciousness of negativity holding fast to the possibility
of what is better. Mistrust is called for in face of all spontaneity, impetuosity,
all letting oneself go, for it implies pliancy towards the superior might
of the existent. The malignant deeper meaning of ease, once confined to the
toasts of conviviality, has long since spread to more appealing impulses.
The chance conversation in the train, when, to avoid dispute, one consents
to a few statements that one knows ultimately to implicate murder, is already
a betrayal; no thought is immune against communication, and to utter it
in the wrong place and in wrong agreement is enough to undermine its truth.
Every visit to the cinema leaves me, against all my vigilance, stupider and
worse. Sociability itself connives at injustice by pretending that in this
chill world we can still talk to each other, and the casual, amiable remark
contributes to perpetuating silence, in that the concessions made to the
interlocutor debase him once more in the person of speaker. The evil principle
that was always latent in affability unfurls its full bestiality in the egalitarian
spirit. Condescension, and thinking oneself no better, are the same. To adapt
to the weakness of the oppressed is to affirm in it the precondition of
power, and to develop in oneself the coarseness, insensibility and violence
needed to exert domination. If, in the latest phase, the condescending gesture
has been dropped and only the adaptation remains visible, this perfect screening
of power only allows the class relationship it denies to triumph more implacably.
For the intellectual, inviolable isolation is now the only way of showing
some measure of solidarity. All collaboration, all the human worth of social
mixing and participation, merely masks a tacit acceptance of inhumanity.
It is the sufferings of men that should be shared: the smallest step towards
their pleasures is one towards the hardening of their pains.
