I am a nuclear physicist working in machine learning and
[homomorphic encryption](https://blog.openmined.org/what-is-homomorphic-encryption/).

## Bio
I received my BS in physics from UC Davis in 2012.
For my senior honors thesis, I studied the [domain wall fermion](https://arxiv.org/abs/hep-lat/9206013)
implementation of chiral fermions in [lattice gauge theory](https://arxiv.org/abs/hep-lat/0012005)
under the guidance of [Professor Joe Kiskis](http://kiskis.physics.ucdavis.edu/kiskis_hp.html).
After graduating, I worked with [Professor Marjorie
Solomon](https://health.ucdavis.edu/team/search/861/marjorie-solomon---clinical-psychology---psychiatry-sacramento)
at the [UC Davis MIND Institute](https://health.ucdavis.edu/mindinstitute/)
using fMRI to study higher cognition in Autism Spectrum Disorder.

I completed my PhD in physics at the University of Virginia in 2021.
My research under [Professor Nilanga Liyanage](http://www.phys.virginia.edu/People/personal.asp?UID=nl8n), [Professor Krishni Wijesooriya](https://med.virginia.edu/radiation-oncology/uva-radiation-oncology-faculty/medical-physicists/krishni-wijesooriya-ph-d-dabr/),
and [Professor Dipangkar Dutta](http://dd285.physics.msstate.edu) can be divided into three categories:
- Particle-tracking systems for accelerator-based nuclear physics experiments
- Imaging technologies and analysis to improve gamma radiation therapy for lung and soft tissue tumors
- Nuclear/nucleon structure and interactions

After grad school, I began working as a Research Scientist at Meta on the
Transparent Ads Experience team. Our team works to help users, advertisers, and
regulators better understand the ways Meta uses large data sets and machine learning
to serve ads. My work on the team includes building and maintaining data
processing pipelines, developing user surveys, and performing experiments to
improve our the algorithms and models we use to explain Meta's ad ranking
systems.

In 2024, I began working at Old Dominion University
with
[Robert Podschwadt](https://podschwadt.github.io)
and
[Daniel Takabi](https://www.odu.edu/article/odu-names-daniel-takabi-as-director-for-school-of-cybersecurity)
on applications of homomorphic encryption for machine learning.

## PhD Dissertation
Color transparency is a phenomenon in which interactions between the nuclear medium
and particles like protons are attenuated.
My dissertation experiment used a beam of high energy electrons to knock protons out
of carbon nuclei in order to study color transparency.
You can read a description of the experiment [here]({{ site.baseurl }}/portfolio/02_color-transparency/).
