I am a nuclear physicist seeking employment as a data scientist or software engineer.

## Bio
I received my BS in physics and mathematics from UC Davis in 2012.
For my senior honors thesis, I studied the [domain wall fermion](https://arxiv.org/abs/hep-lat/9206013) implementation of chiral fermions in [lattice gauge theory](https://arxiv.org/abs/hep-lat/0012005) under the guidance of [Professor Joe Kiskis](http://kiskis.physics.ucdavis.edu/kiskis_hp.html).
After graduating, I worked for [Professor Marjorie Solomon](https://health.ucdavis.edu/team/search/861/marjorie-solomon---clinical-psychology---psychiatry-sacramento) at the [UC Davis MIND Institute](https://health.ucdavis.edu/mindinstitute/) using fMRI to study higher cognitive skills in Autism Spectrum Disorder.

I began my PhD in physics at the University of Virginia in 2014.
My research under [Professor Nilanga Liyanage](http://www.phys.virginia.edu/People/personal.asp?UID=nl8n) and [Professor Dipangkar Dutta](http://dd285.physics.msstate.edu) can be divided into four categories:
- Nuclear/nucleon structure
- Nuclear medium modifications
- Development of particle-tracking detector systems
- In situ imaging for gamma ray cancer therapy

## PhD Dissertation
Color transparency is a phenomenon in which interactions between the nuclear medium and particles like protons are attenuated.
My dissertation experiment used a beam of high energy electrons to knock protons out of carbon nuclei in order to study color transparency.
