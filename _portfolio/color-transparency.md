title: Color Transparency
---

"Color transparency" refers to the vanishing of initial and final state interactions in exclusive processes at large momentum transfer.
My [dissertation experiment](https://www.jlab.org/exp_prog/proposals/06/PR12-06-107.pdf) took data in early 2018 to study [the onset of color transparency](https://arxiv.org/abs/1211.2826) in quasielastic scattering off a carbon-12 target.
That's a lot of jargon, so let's take a step back.

## Historical uses of particle beams to study nuclear structure

Around 1910, Rutherford, Geiger, and Marsden used a beam of alpha particles incident on a gold foil to study atomic structure.
Their results suggested that the atom is composed of a small, dense, positively charged nucleus surrounded by a cloud of electrons.

In the century since, physicists have used other particle beams to study the substructure of nuclei as well as the nucleons (i.e. protons and neutrons) that compose nuclei.
The culmuniation of decades of such experiments is a theory called quantum chromodynamics (QCD): the theory that quarks and gluons are the fundamental building blocks that make up hadrons, a category of composite particles that includes protons and neutrons.

The Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility (JLab) in Newport News, VA is home to the Continuous Electron Beam Accelerator Facility (CEBAF).
The CEBAF beam delivers a 12 GeV beam of polarized electrons to four experimental halls.
Most JLab experiments study the debris produced when the CEBAF electron beam hits a fixed nuclear target.
By studying this debris, physicists are able to obtain new insights into nuclear and nucleon structure, exotic configurations of quarks, and other facets of QCD.

## Scattering in classical physics
Now what exactly is "quasielastic scattering"?
Elastic scattering is something you might be familiar with from introductory physics courses.
In Newtonian physics, an elastic collision is one in which kinetic energy is conserved.
A canonial example is an air hockey puck hitting another puck on a frictionless plane.
An inelastic collision is one in which kinetic energy is not conserved.
A canonical example is two wads of gum colliding and sticking together in zero gravity.

## Scattering in nuclear physics
In nuclear physics, the canonical example of elastic collisions is an electron colliding with a free proton.
The collision is elastic in the sense that the incoming and outgoing particles all retain their "identities."

One of the fun aspects of quantum field theory comes from the intersection of quantum mechanics and relativity.
Energy and matter are in some sense interchangeable, so some of the energy contained in colliding particles can be converted into mass.
This is how collisions of proton beams at the LHC create short-lived particles like the Higgs boson.

At "low" energies, an electron colliding with a nucleus will kick out a proton or neutron.
Physicists can use this process to study how tightly bound individual nucleons are in a paritcular nucleus.
This is an interesting pursuit in its own right.

At higher energies, some of this E=mc^2 energy can be converted into "new" particles!
Instead of nucleons, particles like pions, kaons, and muons come out of the collision.
At this energy scale, we start probing sub-nucleon structures instead of nuclear structures.
Physicsts call these types of interactions "deep inelastic scattering" because we are using scattering processes to study the "deep" structure of strongly interacting matter.

Quasielastic scattering is the "low" energy process where the collision looks like the elastic case of an electron colliding with a free proton.
None of the energy is converted into "new" particles.
The electron transfers momentum to one of a nucleus's constituent proton, removing it from its bound state in the nucleus.
This interaction is called "quasielastic" because it looks more like an electron hitting a free proton than it does a deep inelastic interaction.

Compare to billiards.

## Color Transparency
Squeezing and freezing.
Coherence length.
Nuclear transparency should rise with momentum transfer.

## Our results
[Our results](https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.00703) do not show a rise in transparency.
